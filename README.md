**Restful API for ITP Understanding Networks**

Get started with `npm install`, and then `node getPost.js` to start the server. 
Separately, `cd` into `babyClient/` and run a simpleHTTPServer with the tools of your choice. 

You can also just curl your served endpoints, and ignore babyClient altogether. 

Right now, the server just returns unhelpful text responses, but babyClient will allow you to see the console log, where all the magic is happening. Eventually, we should have the server respond with json or something else that might be helpful to the physical interface (LED sentiment meter for each candidate??).
