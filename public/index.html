			  <strong><i>Read the Room</i></strong> allows guests at private debate-watching parties show their feelings about the debates candidates by upvoting and downvoting as they watch. Guests can vote whenever they feel moved to do so, meaning that the displayed sentiment is a sort of live "pulse" showing how the room is receiving the most recent words and actions of each candidate.

			<p>In this instance of Read the Room, we have provided a "host" client for an upcoming Democratic Debate. We chose the following presidential candidates: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Andrew Yang. By visiting the "Go Read the Room" link below, guests at our debate watch party can see how these candidates fare during the next debate. While watching, they'll be asked to submit votes as the "Go Vote" link. They can vote whenever and as often as they like, as we are interested not only in their affect but also their levels of enthusiasm.</p>
